# TicketModifiedFilesPlugin

A Trac plugin that lists the files that have been modified during the
resolution of a ticket (i.e. ticket-related modified files). It also checks if
the files have been modified to resolve other tickets, in order to warn the
developer about possible conflicting tickets.
